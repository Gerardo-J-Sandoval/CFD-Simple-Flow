# Subsonic and Sonic Flow Over a 2D NACA 2412 Airfoil

### <p align="center"> Simple Terms Summary </p>  
This projects is about air flow over a simple NASA airplane wing shape - the 2412 airfoil wing -  using the software Ansys Fluent. The airfoil shape was created by downloading plotting data from an airfoil plotter website and imported into Ansys Workbench 2025. The results of the project are air flow speeds (velocity) and pressure (force on the airplane wing area) and force coefficients of the air flow over the wing.     

### <p align="center"> Summary </p>
This project focuses on incompressible flow (subsonic) over a 2-Dimensional NACA 2412 airfoil using ANSYS Fluent. Geometry is generated from plotting data, and simulations at varying angles of attack generate lift and drag coefficients and flow contours. Results are compared with NASA data to validate CFD accuracy and demonstrate software proficiency.

*Image 1 shows the velocity of the air flow around the airfoil - note that the incoming air speed is 45.6 meters/second which is the Bright Orange color in front and behind the airfoil. The air flow speed decreases (slower than incoming air) as it collides with the airfoil - shown as yellow, green, and blue - at the leftmost and rightmost side of the airfoil. Also in Image 1, the air velocity increases around the airfoil at the top and bottom of the airfoil, shown in red, at speeds of 50.0 - 56.0 meters/second.*

*Image 2 shows the pressure contour where the static air pressure is 92.6 Pascals - note that the air pressure increases as it collides with the airfoil in the leftmost side and as it exits the airfoil in the rightmost side - shown in yellow, green, and red.*

Image 3. Turbulence contour at Mach 1.5 (497 m/s) at 16° Angle of Attack

*Image 3. shows elevated turbulent kinetic energy concentrated along the upper surface and in the wake region. This indicates strong boundary layer interaction and flow separation due to shock-induced effects at high angle of attack. The wide turbulent wake suggests increased drag and unsteady flow behavior downstream.*
