# CFD-Simple-Flow

Simple terms Summary:  
This projects is about air flow over a simple NASA airplane wing shape using the software Ansys Fluent  

Abstract  
This project focuses on incompressible flow (subsonic) over a 2D NACA 2412 airfoil using ANSYS Fluent. Geometry is generated from plotting data, and simulations at varying angles of attack generate lift and drag coefficients and flow contours. Results are compared with NASA data to validate CFD accuracy and demonstrate software proficiency. Image 1 shows the velocity of the air flow around
